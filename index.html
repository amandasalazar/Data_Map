    <div class="container text">
      <p>Nine percent of all Americans — 28.8 million individuals — will develop an eating disorder at some point in their lifetimes, according to a 2020 study from Harvard School of Public Health’s Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders.</p>
      <p>The study, titled, “Economic Costs of Eating Disorders by State,” estimates that 9% of residents of each state will develop some kind of an eating disorder.</p>
      <p>While the percentage of people from each state with eating disorders may remain consistent, access to treatment is not the same in every state. Larger states and states with populous cities, such as California and New York, tend to have greater access to treatment.</p>
      <p>“The number of treatment options available do not correlate to the prevalence of eating disorders in a certain area,” National Eating Disorder Association spokesperson Lauren Smolar said. NEDA is the country’s largest non-profit eating disorder organization. “In addition, not all insurance will fully cover eating disorder treatment at all levels, which can be a barrier to accessing quality care.”</p>
      <p>The five states with the highest number of inpatient hospitalizations for people with eating disorders — California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois — all have an urban percentage of 84% and above. Urban percentage is the percentage of the total population in urban areas for each state.</p>

      <p>Urban areas have larger populations and more treatment options than rural areas, but they don’t necessarily have more eating disorders per capita than rural areas.</p>
      <p>“More rural areas tend to have less resources for specializing in resources and some locations have more specialty programs than others, regardless of population,” Smolar said.</p>
